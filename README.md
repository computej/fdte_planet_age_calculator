A javascript interface for (temporarily) writing down notes

## Description

This is mockup of a bare-bones journaling app that I created created to learn how to use NPM and Webpack.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Webpack

## Installation:

This needs to be done on npm@8.19.4 in the order written:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Then, a folder called 'dist' should appear. Simply open dist/index.html in your browser.

## Known Issues:
